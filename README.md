This repo contains my personal configurations for the tools i use in Linux, Mac and Windows. 
The configurations for some tools are mostly shared but for those that are specifics of an OS are splitted in the correspondent directory.
This is case for wezterm, as currently there is no viable option for multiplexers like tmux or zellij in windows, wezterm fulfills this requirement quite well, so it has its configuration to split panels and move around them in windows.

Feel free to use any of this configs if you find them suitable or modified them at your please.
